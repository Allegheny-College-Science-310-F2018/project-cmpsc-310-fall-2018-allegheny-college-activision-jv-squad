# Project Idea(s)
# Group members: Austin Bristol and Karol Vargas

1. Python game to play a 2d soccer game. It will be a top down view of a soccer
field and the player can run into the ball to move it. The goal would be to put
the ball in the net. The artificial intelligence portion of this assignment
would be having a computer player to play against which tries to protect its
goal as well as score against the player.

2. Very big extension to the survival shooter game. Add more mechanics like
powerups to get better guns and other things. Other objects to shoot which will
cause the enemies to run towards it. We could add different ways to score points
and add a more complex enemy AI; more kinds of enemies such as ones which could
shoo back.

3. Pool game where you can play billards against an AI. The game will be made in
Unity with its built in 3d environment. Try and make the AI as perfect as
possible in order to win the game.
